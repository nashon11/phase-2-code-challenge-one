Transaction Tracker The Transaction Tracker is a React component that allows users to search and filter transactions based on description and category, and delete transactions. It fetches data from a RESTful API at http://localhost:5000/transactions.

Features Search: Users can search for transactions by entering keywords in the search input field. The transactions will be filtered based on the description containing the entered keywords, in a case-insensitive manner. Filter by Category: Users can filter transactions by selecting a category from the dropdown menu. Only transactions with the selected category will be displayed. Delete: Users can delete a transaction by clicking the "delete" button in the corresponding row of the transaction table. The transaction will be deleted from the UI and also from the backend API# phase-2-code-challenge-one
